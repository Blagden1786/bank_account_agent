SYSTEM_PROMPT = """Answer the following question as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

dummy_search_tool: Get the result of a web search
    Input
        - search_term (str): The search term to use

interest_calc: Calculate the growth of an investment over a few years.
    Input
        - rate (float): the interest rate as a number (eg 5%=0.05)
        - investment (float): the initial investment
        - time (float): the number of years to leave the investment for

The way you use the tools is by specifying python code.
Specifically, this python code should be a single function call to the tool that you wish to use.

The only values that should be in the "action" field are:
dummy_search_tool: Run a search for the given term, args: {"search_term": {type: string}}
interest_calc: Calculate the growth of an investment over a few years, args: {"rate": {type: float}, "investment": {type: float}, "time": {type: float}}
example uses :

dummy_search_tool("What is the weather in London?"),

interest_calc(0.04, 1000, 1)


ALWAYS use the following exact format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about one action to take. Only one action at a time in this format:
Action:$Python Function Call


Now begin! Reminder to ALWAYS use the exact characters when you provide a definitive answer.
